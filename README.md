# Project Euler Challenge

Project Euler currently has over 600 problems to hone your mathematical and programming skills.

Full archive here --> [Project Euler Archives](https://projecteuler.net/archives)

I am currently using these problems to practice my Python and JavaScript skills. In the future, I may add solutions in other languages as I learn them :grin:

## Challenge Progress:

| Language   | Problems completed |
| ---------- | ------------------ |
| JavaScript | 1-3                |
| Python     | 1-3                |

## A Note on solutions in this repo:

**These are not tested to be the fastest/most efficient way to solve the problems.**

Although some people like to also take on the challenge of creating the most efficient code to cut down on the processing time it takes to solve these problems, I am currently only writing code that is able to get the job done.
